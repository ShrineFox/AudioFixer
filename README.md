# AudioFixer
Simple commandline program that changes your Windows default audio devices to the following whenever you run it:
- VoiceMeeter Input
- VoiceMeeter Aux Input
- VoiceMeeter Output
- VoiceMeeter Aux Output  
I made this because it's always annoyed me that Windows automatically changes your default devices whenever  
you plug in another device. At least with this, I can fix it in one click whenever it happens.
